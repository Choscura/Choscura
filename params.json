{"name":"Choscura","tagline":"Kendall Meade's Personal page","body":"Hi there.\r\n\r\nThis is a personal page which I'm using as a landing point for a series of related projects I want to get the ball rolling on. On the basis that I might go out and get hit by a bus, I want this information recorded, because I think this series of projects will eventually be undertaken by some majority of the human species whether I am involved or not, and if I am not, I want my data available to whoever else may be making decisions where my data is relevant.\r\n\r\nProject list:\r\n* Expletive Project\r\n\r\n This is a project aimed at ending piracy. It's being run with the intent of being a company, so that it can be self-sustaining as a solution to the fiscal problem of distribution.\r\n\r\n* Humanity's To-do List\r\n\r\n This is a project aimed at organizing a collection of projects and data sets aimed at moving the human species forwards. The goal of this project is To identify, propose, invent, and implement solutions to problems, issues, and goals affecting the whole human species, including every knowable instance of all human cultures, ethnicities, and language groups, and the ecosystems those members of our species lived or live in.\r\n\r\n The ultimate goals of this project are simple: ubiquitous access to food, water, medical treatment, health services, society, education, economy and industry.\r\n\r\n* WikiWeapon project.\r\n\r\n On the basis that all members of the human species are equal (at least by default), none of us has more nor less right to weapons than any other.  Because firearms are the single highest-performance category of machine which is mass-produced, The ability to produce them can be used to indicate the state of an industry. If the state of industry in a location can be increased sufficiently to produce a firearm where it was not previously possible, it also becomes possible to produce other- more practical- items. Because we are a species of hominid that is frequently at conflict with itself, and because we haven't quite fought back all the monsters in the shadows on the dark side of our planet, having a defensive weapon- which is used responsibly by those fit to do so- is a right, the restriction of which we should naturally be skeptical and wary of.\r\n\r\n So to this end, this is a project aimed at producing a single weapon, at least to start, which can be produced wholly from off-the-shelf components and ubiquitous materials, with the aid of a 3D printer and similarly ubiquitous and cheap tools. Because if you can do this, you can also make an engine, or an electric motor.\r\n\r\n* Terraforming project\r\n\r\n Short version: 40 foot shipping container gets dropped on a beach, the contents must unpack themselves and begin using available resources (ie, sun, sand, salt water) to create sufficient stockpiles of food, fresh water, building materials and suitable storage structures, and energy <electricity>, within one (1) year, to sustain one (1) person for one further year.\r\n\r\n* Earthship/Smart House project\r\n\r\n Cracker-box houses suck, there are existing and easily implementable solutions to housing to make it more available for people than it currently is, and even current state-of-the-art development has not sufficiently accounted for the changing pace of technology. This is an attempt at finding some solutions to these problems and building these houses. A successful outcome of this project is a legal grid-attached but utility-agnostic house, capable of growing and storing a meaningful quantity of food, keeping a controlled climate, collecting & treating rainwater, treating sewage and gray water, and storing up a pragmatic amount of electrical charge- enough to run power for 12 hours, depending on level of output. These houses should also have a central computer monitoring the basic tasks of optimizing this house- the missing element in existing Earthship designs, and the basic automation that such high-performance housing needs in order to be brought to the masses.\r\n\r\n* Terminatrix\r\n\r\n Biology has solved a set of problems that robotics, artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience and brain modelling haven't; this is a project based on bringing a set of functionality of patern-identifying and matching, input correlation, self-awareness, and abstract understanding. A successful implementation of this project would look something like a mobile robotic arm which could build a house or some other structure, given sufficient resources and materials for doing so.\r\n\r\n* Faith Healing\r\n\r\n This is a project aimed at discovering the truth or falsehood of claims and assertions made by different religions, faiths, cults, and spiritual movements. If any religion is factually correct, this project aims at discovering it. These memes will be examined in their own terms, and internal, scientific, historic, logical, and theological contradictions will be numbered and accounted for, and the results subsequently translated and made available.  Maybe one will turn out to be correct; more probably, an ever-increasing number will be, for all practical purposes, 'ruled out'.  \r\n\r\n This project makes no assertion about the existence or absence of gods, but seeks to only comment about the truth or falsehoods of testable and falsifiable claims, assertions, and revelations. We may never know if there is a god, but it's reasonable to think we can know which gods it isn't, even if one or more does exist.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
